Hi, my name is Feng from Holbrook Pipe. I just wanted to reach out to see if you’ll be needing pipe for any ongoing or upcoming projects.

We can quote pricing on any of your projects, and we deliver to all of New York as well as parts of New Jersey and Connecticut. We’re also WBE and DBE certified in case you ever need minority participation.

If you have any ongoing projects, feel free to send me a list of materials.
Otherwise, you can reach out to me if you have any questions.
